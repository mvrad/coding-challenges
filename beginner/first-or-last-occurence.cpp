/*
 * Find the first or last occurrence of a given number in a sorted array
 * 
 * Given a sorted integer array, find the index of a given number's first or last occurence.
 * If the element is not present in the array, report that as well.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input:
 * arr = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]
 * target = 5
 * 
 * Output:
 * The first occurrence of element 5 is located at index 1
 * The last occurrence of element 5 is located at index 3
 * 
 * Input:
 * arr = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]
 * target = 4
 * 
 * Output:
 * Element not found in the array
